Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), have been of great concern, due to their toxicity in low concentrations and bioaccumulating properties that lead to alarming concentrations in the ecosystem. Current detection methods, which are performed by analyzing massive amounts of water samples in the lab, cannot properly measure the low levels of POPs nor differentiate them. Our project, Sensing-Persistent Organic Pollutants (S-POP), aims to solve this issue by creating a monitor containing two major parts, a modular <i>E. coli </i>biosensor coupled with a microbial fuel cell (MFC). When <i>E. coli </i>is activated by the pollutant a quorum sensing (QS) molecule is produced. Upregulated by the QS-molecule, engineered <i>Shewanella oneidensis </i>produces an oscillating electrical signal that corresponds to the type and quantity of pollutants in the sample.<h2>Authors and their Affiliated Institutions</h2>Aditi Kallai (Karolinska Institute), Astha Kaul (Karolinska Institute), Athina Eleftheraki (Karolinska Institute), Corinna Mayer (Karolinska Institute), Hanna Mårtensson (KTH Royal Institute of Technology), Julie Cordier (KTH Royal Institute of Technology), Layung Wikanthi (Karolinska Institute), Richard Brunsell (KTH Royal Institute of Technology), Sofia Klangby (Uppsala University), Umme Hany Islam (Karolinska Institute), Victoria Muliadi (Karolinska Institute), Xinhe Xing (Karolinska Institute)</div></div></div></div><div class="row-poster"><div class="section full first_text" id="introduction"><img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/2/2a/T--Stockholm--Poster_introduction.png"/><div class="info"><div class="title">Introduction</div><div class="text"><img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/1/1c/T--Stockholm--Poster_introduction_pic.png"/>Water is essential for life on our planet. Without clean water sources, the entire ecosystem suffers and there is no valuable solution in sight yet. To reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the methods for monitoring aquatic pollutant concentrations need to be cheaper, more accessible and more accurate (1).<h2>The Problem</h2>Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) like PCBs and PFOS are a group of problematic pollutants that are not readily degraded in the environment and bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms (2,3). Exposure to POPs can lead to reproductive disorders, neurobehavioral impairment, increased risk of cancer, genotoxicity and increased birth defects (4). The Baltic sea, which is landlocked and less resilient than other ecosystems due to lower biodiversity, is in great danger because of POP pollution (5,6,7).<h2>Our Solution</h2><i>Shewanella oneidensis </i>produces an electrical output in anaerobic conditions through an electricity-producing gene which, when knocked out, can be reintroduced and controlled by an engineered plasmid. Induction of this gene using quorum sensing molecules produced by an engineered<i>E. coli</i>can couple electricity production to pollutant detection. For better detection, the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by using an oscillatory circuit to control the current. The fully developed S-POP system can be used to continuously monitor pollutant concentrations and improve efforts for pollution prevention.<h2>References</h2><p class="reference">(1) Practices of Science: Scientific Error.

We created genetic circuits using SnapGene and optimised them until simulations confirmed we could get a unique oscillatory electrical output upon detection of a specific pollutant. Genetic circuits for detection were characterised using fluorescence measurements and Western blotting, while electricity production was measured by building a microbial fuel cell. The division of tasks is shown in Figure 1 below. For each experiment and simulation, we identified problems and solved them methodically so that scientifically correct results could be produced (Figure 2). This included the use of negative and positive controls as well as repetitions of measurements. A troubleshooting guide to Western Blotting was also created to help future teams.<img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/a/a0/T--Stockholm--Poster_Engineering--cycle.png"/><p class="caption">Figure 2: Engineering cycle for our project</p></div></div></div><div class="section half" id="model"><img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/9/9d/T--Stockholm--Poster_model.png"/><div class="info"><div class="title">Model</div><div class="text"><img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/5/56/T--Stockholm--Poster_modelanim.gif"/><p class="caption">Figure 3: Animated descriptive diagram of the oscillatory system</p><p></p>A system of delayed differential equations was used to predict whether our genetic circuit could create pollutant-specific electrical oscillations. Oscillations are established in a <i>Shewanella oneidensis </i>mtrB knockout strain thanks to the co-existence of positive and negative feedback loops. These loops are controlled by the production and degradation of quorum sensing molecules emitted by <i>E. coli </i>upon binding of pollutants. Our first system contained the feedback loops and electricity reporter parts under the same promoter. This led to time-dependent oscillation phases, which could be a problem since cells are spatially distributed and QS-signalling is diffusion dependent. To avoid destructive interferences, the genetic circuit was adjusted so that simulations proved that time-independent oscillations could be obtained. Higher levels of mtrB expression (i.e. higher current) were observed for pollutant-induced cells than from promoter leakiness.</div></div></div></div><div class="row-poster"><div class="section third" id="mfc"><img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/b/be/T--Stockholm--Poster_mfc.png"/><div class="info"><div class="title">MFC</div><div class="text">The wildtype strain of <i>S. oneidensis </i>MR-1 (WT) and the mtrB knockout (KO) strain were cultivated in the microbial fuel cell (MFC) we built and electricity production was monitored for 450 h.<img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/1/16/T--Stockholm--Poster_Results--MFC_WT2.png"/><p class="caption">Figure 4: Measurement of current over time in red, with the different phases in cyan</p><p></p>Initial addition of Lysogeny Broth (LB) growth medium resulted in a steady current increase to 20 μA over 260 h, suggesting that either a biofilm generated on the electrode or cells in suspension produced electricity. Addition of fresh LB resulted in a rapid current increase to 130 µA followed by a plateau. This confirmed successful biofilm growth and stabilization due to biofouling of the electrode and/or nutrient limitation in the chamber. Change to M9 medium with lactic acid as the only carbon source resulted in, after an initial current drop, a steady increase upon addition of more lactic acid to the media, suggesting growth limitation by nutrient availability. The KO strain was grown in similar conditions and no electricity generation was observed, as hypothesized. The introduction of a circuit containing mtrB can be expected to re-establish controlled electricity production in the MFC.</div></div></div><div class="section third" id="characterization"><img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/f/f9/T--Stockholm--Poster_characterization.png"/><div class="info"><div class="title">Characterization</div><div class="text">Successful gene insertion was confirmed through sequencing after cloning.

However, no color change was detected upon co-culturing of i C. violaceum with AHL producing constructs (LuxI and RhlI), perhaps due to the concentrations of AHL produced being below i C. violaceum sensitivity levels.<h2>Viability Assay</h2>Viability assays showed no notable impact in the survival and growth of our pollutant-sensing host organisms as well as Top 10 <i>E. coli </i>BL21 up to pollutant threshold values of 10-3 M of 1,1-biphenyl and 125 µM PFOS.</div></div></div><div class="section third" id="conclusion"><img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/5/51/T--Stockholm--Poster_conclusion.png"/><div class="info"><div class="title">Conclusion</div><div class="text">The results from the MFC experiment suggest that the WT <i>S. oneidensis </i>strain could form a biofilm on the MFC anode rendering electricity production as opposed to the mtrB knock-out strain. Hence, reintroduction of mtrB containing circuits under the control of an inducible promoter would presumably generate electricity in a controlled manner upon promoter induction. Successful functionality of the QS signaling constructs was observed through fluorescence results and protein expression of the QS proteins; LuxI, RhlI and LuxR was observed through positive WB bands, suggesting viable QS transmission between the cellular modules. The viability assay suggests survival and growth of our host cells at pollutant concentrations well above levels found in nature and industrial environments. The pollutant sensing genes did not operate as hypothesized, and require further optimization.</div></div></div></div><div class="row-poster"><div class="section third" id="implementation"><img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/6/68/T--Stockholm--Poster_implementation.png"/><div class="info"><div class="title">Implementation</div><div class="text"><img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/3/33/T--Stockholm--Poster_Implementation--overview.png"/><p class="caption">Figure 8: Schematic of the two potential implementation locations of S-POP microbial fuel cells into the sewerage system</p><p></p>S-POP has been designed as a modular biosensor to address the need for a rapid, reliable and economical system to detect and distinguish between the aquatic pollutants threatening our water bodies. The modularity of S-POP supports flexible implementation options. Future modifications could allow detection of various additional aquatic pollutants, whilst implementation of parallel systems enables multiple pollutant monitoring within the same aquatic environment.<p></p>Bioethical safety measures are key in implementation, with focus on bacterial strain containment through filtration and sterilization as well as system maintenance and quality control through regular check-ups by experienced technicians. Quick source identification and continuous monitoring are crucial in ensuring early action for pollutant control and S-POP offers an on-the-spot, almost real-time detection system for this need.
